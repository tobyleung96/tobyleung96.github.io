        A candidate for IDEC’s Experience Design competition, the Fiboacci’s Labyrinth utilizes the golden ratio to bring about a natural comfort that is immediately recognizable. Mother earth has utilized this beautiful fusion of art and mathematics to create, and Fibonacci's Labyrinth follows suit. The history of labyrinths have ties closely with meditation, as they have been used as a spiritual tool for thousands of years. As one walks into the single line path, they ponder their discomfort and troubles. Once reaching the center, one meditates to the kiss of daylight, and leaves their inner burdens in the center of the labyrinth as they retreat out the same path.
