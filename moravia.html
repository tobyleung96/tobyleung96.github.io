        To redesign Moravia High School's senior lounge for it to provide a space with resources to support academic, social, and wellbeing needs of seniors.

      <div id="subHeader">Concept: The High Line</div>
      <div id="introText">
        The current use of the senior lounge is circulation and
        movement. Inspired by this function and the narrow
        existing architecture, our design celebrates this egress
        pathway by transforming it into a metaphor for the “High
        Line” located in New York City. Our design revamps the
        existing space through the creation of a new “Living
        System” that connects natural elements and railroad
        industrial design very reminiscent of the features found
        throughout The High Line. Through the synergy of these
        features and different varieties of furniture formations,
        the senior lounge still promotes connectivity while becoming
        a new dynamic enclosure of its own.

        <div id="subHeader">Stakeholder Interviews</div>
        The first stage in every design process is to understand the stakeholders of the project. Our team
        went to visit Moravia High School to talk to the stakeholders of: high school seniors, teachers, headmasters, and janitors.
        Through user surveys and interviews, we arrived at several points of information to base our design decisions off of.

        The corridor has almost full height windows spanning across its entire length, thus sunlight
        and views from inside were exteremely important aspects to consider.
